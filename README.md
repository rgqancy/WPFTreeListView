I fix the bug spend about two or three days at spare time when i working at MSRA as a vendor on-site on 2010 December.
I am afraid to the copyright issue that time,so i can't give out the code as open source.
As so many year goï¼ŒI find many people need control like this,so i decide to give out the source which is fixed memory leak.
Certainly you can get a control like this from Telerik :http://www.telerik.com/(I think it's a good vendor for windows control)
