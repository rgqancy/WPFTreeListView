I fix the bug spend about two or three days at spare time when i working at MSRA as a vendor on-site on 2010 December.
I am afraid to the copyright issue that time,so i can't give out the code as open source.
As so many year goï¼ŒI find many people need control like this,so i decide to give out the source which is fixed memory leak.
you can donate to me if you think my work help to you. you can find me with the account rgqancy@163.com at alipay and the acount rgqancy at wechat. i am so sorry i don't have a paypal accout for people all over the world.
Certainly you can get a control like this from Telerik :http://www.telerik.com/(I think it's a good vendor for windows control)
